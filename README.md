## UX (User Experience):

### Project Goals

 * Users will be able to research the various products and bundles on offer in terms of price, size and description.
 * Potential buyers can create their own accounts to pay for the desired gifts and deliver them directly to the gift recipient if they so choose.
 * Arising from the creation of the site, gift recipients and gift senders will enjoy a greater, more personlised experience.

## Site Layout & Design:

### Wireframes
Initially, I wrote down all of the ideas that I had for this site. Once I had firmly decided on the project, I drew rough sketches of my vision for the site on pen and paper. Following the refining of my designs through more wireframe drafts, I created electronic versions of these wireframes using the Balsamiq Wireframes software. The final versions of the wireframes are stored in PDF format, for the following viewing mediums:

 * Mobile
 * Desktop
 * Tablet

### Colour Scheme

![Colour Scheme](https://github.com/shane-os/atlas-gifts/blob/main/wireframes/atlas_gifts_colour_palette.png)

For the Atlas Gifts project, I decided to use colours that convey a range of emotions to both inspire confidence in the site user and entice them to purchase particular items. For example: The indigo Dye shade of blue is used in the payment section of the website to invoke trust and security in the user. The colour palette seen above and the accompanying report available in the wireframes folder was created using the [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) website. The main colours utilised in this project were:

 * #000000 - Black - Headings & main body text
 * #083d77 - Indigo Dye - Payment processing area
 * #C41C1F - Venetian Red - Item bundles & delivery section
 * #11844A - Sea Green - Item bundles & shopping cart
 * #FC4C02 - International Orange Aerospace - Item bundles
 * #FFFFFF - White - Background & footer text
